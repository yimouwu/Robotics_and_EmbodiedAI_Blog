# Robotics_and_EmbodiedAI_Blog

## Welcome to Yimou's Robotics and Embodied AI Blog

This is where I share my research, thoughts, and work on robotics and embodied AI. Here you'll find literature reviews, paper analyses, and technical deep dives into topics like Kalman Filters, Jacobian Matrices, Model Predictive Control, and more.

I'm currently focusing on robotics research, particularly in control systems and machine learning applications for robotic manipulators.
