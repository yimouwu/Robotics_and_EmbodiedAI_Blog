## **1. Running Neural Networks in MATLAB**

### **1.1 Introduction to MATLAB and Neural Networks**

MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It provides extensive tools for developing algorithms, analyzing data, and creating models and applications.

For neural networks, MATLAB offers the **Deep Learning Toolbox** (formerly known as Neural Network Toolbox), which provides algorithms, pre-trained models, and apps to create, train, visualize, and simulate neural networks.

### **1.2 MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox**

**Deep Learning Toolbox** enables you to perform deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other architectures for classification, regression, feature extraction, and transfer learning.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Pre-trained Models**: Access to models like AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet for transfer learning.
- **Apps**: Interactive tools like the Neural Net Pattern Recognition app and Neural Net Fitting app.
- **Training Algorithms**: A variety of training algorithms, such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization, and Scaled Conjugate Gradient.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing network architecture, training progress, and performance.

### **1.3 Creating and Training Neural Networks**

You can create and train neural networks in MATLAB in two main ways:

1. Using the interactive apps.
2. Programmatically using MATLAB scripts.

#### **1.3.1 Using the Neural Network App (nntool)**

The Neural Network app allows you to interactively design and train neural networks.

**Steps:**

1. **Open the App:**

   ```matlab
   nntool
   ```

2. **Import Data:**

   - Prepare your input (`X`) and target (`T`) data.
   - Data should be in the form of matrices.
   - In the app, import your data variables.

3. **Create a Network:**

   - Choose the type of network (e.g., Feedforward, Pattern Recognition, Fitting).
   - Specify the number of hidden layers and neurons.

4. **Train the Network:**

   - Select the training algorithm.
   - Configure training parameters.
   - Start the training process.

5. **Evaluate the Network:**

   - View performance metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
   - Visualize training progress.
   - Test the network with new inputs.

#### **1.3.2 Programmatically Creating Neural Networks**

You can also create and train networks using MATLAB scripts, which provides more flexibility.

**Example: Feedforward Neural Network for Function Approximation**

```matlab
% Load sample data
[x, t] = simpleseries_dataset;

% Create a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 10 neurons
net = feedforwardnet(10);

% Split data into training, validation, and test sets
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100;

% Train the network
[net, tr] = train(net, x, t);

% Evaluate performance
outputs = net(x);
performance = perform(net, t, outputs);

% Plot results
figure;
plotperform(tr);
```

**Explanation:**

- `simpleseries_dataset`: Sample time-series data.
- `feedforwardnet(10)`: Creates a network with 10 neurons in the hidden layer.
- `train`: Trains the network.
- `perform`: Calculates the performance (e.g., MSE).
- `plotperform`: Plots the training performance.

**Example: Classification with Patternnet**

```matlab
% Load sample data
[x, t] = iris_dataset;

% Create a pattern recognition network
net = patternnet(10);

% Train the network
[net, tr] = train(net, x, t);

% Test the network
y = net(x);
classes = vec2ind(y);

% Calculate accuracy
t_ind = vec2ind(t);
accuracy = sum(classes == t_ind) / numel(t_ind);

disp(['Accuracy: ', num2str(accuracy * 100), '%']);
```

### **1.4 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in MATLAB**

CNNs are widely used for image classification and recognition tasks.

**Example: Training a CNN on MNIST Dataset**

```matlab
% Load MNIST data
[XTrain, YTrain] = digitTrain4DArrayData;
[XTest, YTest] = digitTest4DArrayData;

% Define the CNN architecture
layers = [
    imageInputLayer([28 28 1])
    
    convolution2dLayer(3,8,'Padding','same')
    batchNormalizationLayer
    reluLayer
    
    maxPooling2dLayer(2,'Stride',2)
    
    fullyConnectedLayer(10)
    softmaxLayer
    classificationLayer];

% Specify training options
options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
    'MaxEpochs',4, ...
    'ValidationData',{XTest,YTest}, ...
    'ValidationFrequency',30, ...
    'Verbose',false, ...
    'Plots','training-progress');

% Train the network
net = trainNetwork(XTrain,YTrain,layers,options);

% Evaluate the network
YPred = classify(net,XTest);
accuracy = sum(YPred == YTest)/numel(YTest);

disp(['Test Accuracy: ', num2str(accuracy * 100), '%']);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Layers:**
  - `imageInputLayer`: Specifies the input size.
  - `convolution2dLayer`: Convolution layer with filters.
  - `batchNormalizationLayer`: Normalizes activations.
  - `reluLayer`: Applies ReLU activation.
  - `maxPooling2dLayer`: Reduces spatial size.
  - `fullyConnectedLayer`: Connects to output layer.
  - `softmaxLayer` and `classificationLayer`: For classification tasks.
  
- **Training Options:**
  - `'sgdm'`: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum.
  - `'MaxEpochs'`: Number of training epochs.
  - `'ValidationData'`: Data for validation.
  - `'Plots'`: Displays training progress.

### **1.5 Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models**

MATLAB provides pre-trained models that you can fine-tune for your own dataset.

**Example: Transfer Learning with ResNet-18**

```matlab
% Load pre-trained network
net = resnet18;

% Replace the last layers
layersTransfer = net.Layers(1:end-3);
numClasses = numel(categories(YTrain));

layers = [
    layersTransfer
    fullyConnectedLayer(numClasses,'WeightLearnRateFactor',20,'BiasLearnRateFactor',20)
    softmaxLayer
    classificationLayer];

% Set up training options
options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
    'MiniBatchSize',10, ...
    'MaxEpochs',6, ...
    'InitialLearnRate',1e-4, ...
    'ValidationData',{XTest,YTest}, ...
    'ValidationFrequency',3, ...
    'Verbose',false, ...
    'Plots','training-progress');

% Train the network
netTransfer = trainNetwork(XTrain,layers,options);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Layers Replacement:**
  - Remove the last few layers related to the original classification task.
  - Add new layers suitable for your dataset.
- **Learn Rate Factors:**
  - Adjust `'WeightLearnRateFactor'` to control learning rates of specific layers.

### **1.6 Deploying Neural Networks**

After training, you may want to deploy your models.

- **MATLAB Compiler**: Compile your MATLAB code into standalone executables.
- **MATLAB Coder**: Generate C/C++ code from MATLAB code for embedded systems.

**Example: Generating Code for Raspberry Pi**

```matlab
% Generate code configuration
cfg = coder.gpuConfig('mex');
cfg.TargetLang = 'C++';

% Specify input size
inputSize = [28 28 1];

% Generate code
codegen -config cfg myNeuralNetworkFunction -args {ones(inputSize,'single')}
```

```

**Step 2: Load and Prepare Data**

Assuming we have the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize inputs
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0

# One-hot encode outputs
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

**Step 3: Define the Model**

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

**Step 4: Compile the Model**

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

**Step 5: Train the Model**

```python
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    batch_size=128,
                    epochs=10,

plt.show()
```

### **2.5 Example: Building a Neural Network with PyTorch**

**Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Neural Network using PyTorch**

**Step 1: Import Libraries**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
```

**Step 2: Prepare the Data**

```python
# Transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
                                transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])

# Datasets
trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True,
                                      download=True, transform=transform)
testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False,
                                     download=True, transform=transform)

# DataLoaders

                                          shuffle=True)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=64,
                                         shuffle=False)
```

**Step 3: Define the Neural Network**

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28*28, 512)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 10)
        self.softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 28*28)  # Flatten the input
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.softmax(self.fc2(x))
        return x

net = Net()
```

**Step 4: Define Loss Function and Optimizer**

```python

for epoch in range(5):  # Number of epochs
    running_loss = 0.0
    for images, labels in trainloader:
        # Zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        outputs = net(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # Backward pass and optimize
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
    
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {running_loss/len(trainloader)}')
```

**Step 6: Evaluate the Network**

```python
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for images, labels in testloader:
        outputs = net(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print('Test Accuracy: %d %%' % (100 * correct / total))
```

**Step 7: Save and Load the Model**

```python
# Save the model
torch.save(net.state_dict(), 'mnist_net.pth')

# Load the model
net = Net()
net.load_state_dict(torch.load('mnist_net.pth'))
```
