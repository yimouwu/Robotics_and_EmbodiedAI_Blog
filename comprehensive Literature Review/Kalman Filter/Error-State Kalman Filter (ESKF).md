**Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF)**

**Introduction**

The Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) is a variation of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) designed for nonlinear state estimation problems, particularly when dealing with systems that can be decomposed into a nominal state and an error state. The ESKF estimates the error (or deviation) from a nominal trajectory, rather than estimating the full state directly. This approach can improve estimation accuracy and numerical stability, especially in systems with small perturbations around a known trajectory.

**Understanding the Kalman Filter**

Before delving into the ESKF, it's essential to understand the basic Kalman Filter (KF):

- **Kalman Filter:** A recursive algorithm for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It provides optimal estimates in the least-squares sense when the system is linear, and the noise is Gaussian.

- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** An extension of the Kalman Filter used for nonlinear systems. It linearizes the nonlinear system dynamics around the current estimate using a first-order Taylor expansion, but this linearization can introduce errors.

**Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) Overview**

The ESKF reformulates the estimation problem by focusing on the error between the estimated state and the true state. This approach involves:

- **Nominal State (\( \mathbf{x} \)):** A prior estimate or known trajectory of the system state.

- **Error State (\( \delta \mathbf{x} \)):** The deviation or error between the nominal state and the true state (\( \mathbf{x}_{\text{true}} = \mathbf{x} + \delta \mathbf{x} \)).

**Advantages of ESKF:**

- **Improved Linearization:** By estimating the error state, which is expected to be small, the linearization errors introduced during the EKF process are minimized, leading to better estimation accuracy.

- **Numerical Stability:** Operating on error states can reduce numerical instability, especially in systems where the state variables can grow large (e.g., position coordinates).

**Applying the Error-State Kalman Filter**

**1. System Modeling**

Consider a nonlinear system with state \( \mathbf{x} \) and control input \( \mathbf{u} \):

1. **State Transition Model:**
   \[
   \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k) + \mathbf{w}_k
   \]
   where \( f \) is a nonlinear function describing the system dynamics, and \( \mathbf{w}_k \) is the process noise.

2. **Measurement Model:**
   \[
   \mathbf{z}_k = h(\mathbf{x}_k) + \mathbf{v}_k
   \]
   where \( h \) is a nonlinear function relating the state to the measurements, and \( \mathbf{v}_k \) is the measurement noise.

**2. Nominal and Error States**

- **Nominal State (\( \mathbf{x}_k \)):** The best estimate of the state at time \( k \) based on prior information.

- **Error State (\( \delta \mathbf{x}_k \)):** The small deviation from the nominal state:
  \[
  \delta \mathbf{x}_k = \mathbf{x}_{\text{true}, k} - \mathbf{x}_k
  \]

**3. Error-State Dynamics**

Linearize the error dynamics around the nominal state:

- **Linearized State Transition:**
  \[
  \delta \mathbf{x}_{k+1} \approx \mathbf{F}_k \delta \mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{G}_k \mathbf{w}_k
  \]
  where \( \mathbf{F}_k \) is the Jacobian of \( f \) with respect to \( \mathbf{x} \), evaluated at \( \mathbf{x}_k \), and \( \mathbf{G}_k \) is the Jacobian with respect to \( \mathbf{w} \).

- **Linearized Measurement Model:**
  \[
  \delta \mathbf{z}_k = \mathbf{H}_k \delta \mathbf{x}_k + \mathbf{v}_k
  \]
  where \( \mathbf{H}_k \) is the Jacobian of \( h \) with respect to \( \mathbf{x} \), evaluated at \( \mathbf{x}_k \).

**4. ESKF Algorithm Steps**

The ESKF follows similar steps to the standard Kalman Filter but operates on the error state \( \delta \mathbf{x} \):

- **Initialization:**
  - Set initial nominal state \( \mathbf{x}_0 \) and error covariance \( \mathbf{P}_0 \).

- **Prediction Step:**
  - **Nominal State Prediction:**
    \[
    \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)
    \]
  - **Error Covariance Prediction:**
    \[
    \mathbf{P}_{k+1}^{-} = \mathbf{F}_k \mathbf{P}_k \mathbf{F}_k^\top + \mathbf{G}_k \mathbf{Q}_k \mathbf{G}_k^\top
    \]
    where \( \mathbf{Q}_k \) is the process noise covariance.

- **Update Step:**
  - Compute the innovation:
    \[
    \mathbf{y}_k = \mathbf{z}_k - h(\mathbf{x}_{k})
    \]
  - Compute the Kalman Gain:
    \[
    \mathbf{K}_k = \mathbf{P}_{k}^{-} \mathbf{H}_k^\top (\mathbf{H}_k \mathbf{P}_{k}^{-} \mathbf{H}_k^\top + \mathbf{R}_k)^{-1}
    \]
    where \( \mathbf{R}_k \) is the measurement noise covariance.
  - Update the error state estimate:
    \[
    \delta \mathbf{x}_k = \mathbf{K}_k \mathbf{y}_k
    \]
  - Correct the nominal state:
    \[
    \mathbf{x}_{k} \leftarrow \mathbf{x}_{k} + \delta \mathbf{x}_k
    \]
  - Update the error covariance:
    \[
    \mathbf{P}_{k} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{K}_k \mathbf{H}_k) \mathbf{P}_{k}^{-}
    \]

**5. Re-Linearization**

After each update, re-linearize the system around the updated nominal state if necessary, to ensure that the linear approximations remain valid.

**Instructions for Applying the ESKF**

1. **Model the System:**
   - Define the nonlinear system dynamics \( f \) and measurement model \( h \).

2. **Compute Jacobians:**
   - Derive the Jacobian matrices \( \mathbf{F}_k \) and \( \mathbf{H}_k \) analytically or numerically.

3. **Initialize States and Covariances:**
   - Set initial estimates for \( \mathbf{x}_0 \) and \( \mathbf{P}_0 \).

4. **Implement the ESKF Algorithm:**
   - Implement the prediction and update steps as outlined above.

5. **Test and Validate:**
   - Use simulated or real data to test the filter's performance.
   - Validate the filter by comparing the estimated states with ground truth if available.

6. **Tune Covariances:**
   - Adjust \( \mathbf{Q}_k \) and \( \mathbf{R}_k \) to reflect the true process and measurement noise characteristics.

**Neural Networks Mentioned in the Paragraph**

Let's discuss each neural network model mentioned in the paragraph in detail:

**1. Autoregressive (AR) Model**

- **Definition:**
  - An AR model predicts future values based on a linear combination of past values.
  - Mathematically:
    \[
    x_t = \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i x_{t - i} + \epsilon_t
    \]
    where \( \phi_i \) are coefficients, \( p \) is the order, and \( \epsilon_t \) is white noise.

    - \( d \): Degree of differencing.
    - \( q \): Number of moving average terms.

- **Differencing:**
  - The data is differenced \( d \) times to achieve stationarity:
    \[
    y_t = \Delta^d x_t
    \]

- **Usage:**
  - Widely used in time series forecasting when data exhibits trends or nonstationary behaviors.

**3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**

- **Definition:**
  - A class of neural networks designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data by using loops within the network.
  - RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, creating an internal state that captures information about previous inputs.

  - At each time step \( t \), the RNN computes:
    \[
    h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)
    \]
    \[
    y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y
    \]
    where \( h_t \) is the hidden state, \( x_t \) is the input, \( y_t \) is the output, \( W \) are weight matrices, and \( b \) are biases.

      \]
    - Input gate:
      \[
      i_t = \sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
      \]
      \[
      \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
      \]
    - Update cell state:
      \[
      C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t
      \]
    - Output gate:
      \[
      o_t = \sigma(W_o [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
      \]
      \[
      h_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
      \]
    where \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function.

- **Architecture:**
  - The output of the network is:
    \[
    y(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \phi(\| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{c}_i \|) + b
    \]
    where:
    - \( \phi \) is the radial basis function (e.g., Gaussian function).
    - \( \mathbf{c}_i \) are the centers of the RBF neurons.
    - \( w_i \) are the weights.

**6. Wavelet Networks (WN)**

- **Definition:**
  - A special case of RBF networks that use wavelet functions as activation functions.
  - Wavelet functions are localized in both time and frequency domains, providing good time-frequency localization.

- **Architecture:**
  - Similar to RBF networks but with wavelet basis functions:
    \[
    y(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \psi\left( \frac{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}_i}{a_i} \right)
    \]
    where:
